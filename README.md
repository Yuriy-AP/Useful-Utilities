# Useful-Utilities
Helps in data manipulations and analysis, which I used in the research. I include several components: 

File 1. Ways to go about manipulating, grouping, pivoting (panel) data using Pandas.
File 2. Function to create lagged values easily with (panel) data.
File 3. Funciton to calculate marginal effects for an machine learning model.
File 4. R code to construct matched samples, using propensity score matching. It also allows for hard matching (e.g. matching by year or industry).
